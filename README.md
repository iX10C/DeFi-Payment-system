📌 Problem Statement

In a college campus, payments for canteen, events, library, and other services mostly depend on cash or centralized payment systems.
These systems:

Depend on a single authority

Are not transparent

Can fail due to server issues

Involve extra transaction fees

💡 Solution

This project introduces a Decentralized Payment System using blockchain technology for college campuses.

Think of it like this 👶
👉 Instead of one big cashier keeping all records, everyone shares the same notebook, and no one can secretly erase or change anything.

Students can directly pay campus vendors without intermediaries, making transactions:

Secure 🔐

Transparent 👀

Fast ⚡

⚙️ How It Works (Simple)

Student connects their wallet

Selects campus service (canteen, event, etc.)

Makes payment via blockchain

Transaction gets permanently recorded

Vendor receives payment instantly

🚀 Features

Decentralized transactions

No middleman involvement

Secure & tamper-proof payments

Transparent transaction history

Suitable for closed environments like college campuses
